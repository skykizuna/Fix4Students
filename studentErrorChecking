If you got any compiler error please do the following:
1. Rename your file as "studentName_LabNumber_fix"
2. Upload it into the repository
3. If there is any fixes, I will add my comment in the repository and commit the fixed code back to you
4. Give me time to check, sometimes I will need to take my time looking at your code
